## Usage Examples

err := webhookergo.SendSimple("https://discord.com/api/webhooks/...", "Hello, Discord!")
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
```

### Sending an Embed

```
embed := webhookergo.NewEmbed().
    SetTitle("Server Alert").
    SetDescription("The server has restarted successfully").
    SetColorHex("#FF5733").
    SetTimestampNow()

err := webhookergo.SendEmbed("https://discord.com/api/webhooks/...", embed)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
```

### Creating webhook with Embed with Fields

```
webhook := webhookergo.NewWebhook().
	SetContent("Hello, Discord!")
		
embed := webhookergo.NewEmbed().
    SetTitle("Build Report").
    AddField(webhookergo.NewField("Status", "Success", true)).
    AddField(webhookergo.NewField("Duration", "3m45s", true))

webhook.AddEmbed(embed1)

err := webhook.Send("https://discord.com/api/webhooks/...")
